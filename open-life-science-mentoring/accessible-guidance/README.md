# Embedding Accessibility in The Turing Way Open Source Community Guidance

- Project Leads: @nehamoopen, @paulowoicho
- Mentor: @SamGuay

## Roadmap (draft)

The goals for this project are three-fold as discussed in the GSoD proposal:

- Retrospective Consistency (Making existing content of the book consistent)
- Sustainability (Creating templates to guide future contributions to make sure consistency is sustained)
- Accessibility (Making the book more user-friendly)

We plan to dedicate a month to work on each goal (Oct-Dec), starting with Retrospective Consistency over the month of October. Issue #1174 highlights the consistency issues that need to be addressed, but it would be extremely helpful if members of the community could point out other inconsistencies they have found as well. This would help us build a comprehensive list of issues to work on for our consistency goal.

*Development can be tracked in this issue:[OLS-2 issue tracker](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-2/issues/25).*
