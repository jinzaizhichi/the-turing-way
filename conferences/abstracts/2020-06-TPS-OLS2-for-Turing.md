## Title: Open Life Science mentoring and training second cohort

Open Life Science (https://openlifesci.org/) program mentors and trains individuals and stakeholders working in research organisations who want to promote Open Science practice in their communities. 
Participants of this 16-week mentoring & training program learn essential knowledge required to create, lead, and sustain an Open Science project, connect with members across different communities, backgrounds, and identities by sharing their experiences and expertise. 
The complete schedule and participation guidelines of the program are available [online](https://openlifesci.org/syllabus). 

After successfully running the [first cohort this year](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2020/05/27/ols1-wrapup/), they have announced a call for applications for the second round that will take place from September to December 2020.

Under the [Turingâ€™s Tools, Practices and Systems Research Program](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems), Open Life Science has collaborated with [_The Turing Way_](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/turing-way-handbook-reproducible-data-science) to offer training and mentoring to interested members from The Alan Turing Institute who would like to join this program with individual or team projects. 
This program will offer an opportunity to develop Open Science aspects in the projects that participants either already have been working on, or want to develop in the near future. 
Mentors will be preferably selected from The Alan Turing Institute but there will be a possibility to match projects with the right mentor from their current capacity. 
More information regarding the roles and benefits for the mentees and eligibility of a proposed project can be found on their website.

The standard deadline is 30 June 2020 and the application can be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ols2). 
For Turing as a collaborating organisation, this deadline will be extended to 15 July 2020 to ensure that interested participants have sufficient time to discuss their plans with their supervisors within the organisation.
To answer questions related to this program, we hosted online information sessions, notes and video links for which are shared [on this page](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#collaborators).
