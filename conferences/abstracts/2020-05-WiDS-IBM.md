## Title: _The Turing Way_: A community built on a culture of collaboration

In this session Malvika talks about lowering barriers for people (with a focus of women and other minority groups) to participate in online data science projects.
This talk will introduce _The Turing Way_ project that aims to bridge the gap between innovative data research techniques and best practices that make them accessible and comprehensible for everyone.
