## Title: _The Turing Way_: A community built on a culture of collaboration

**About the event:** This summer, MIT is piloting a new course for about 90 undergraduates, Experiential Ethics, in which students explore ethical and social issues relevant to their own experiences, with a focus on technology and social justice.

During the Experiential Ethics Virtual Field Trip, Malvika Sharan talked about The Turing Way, shared the overall goal of the project and introduced The Turing Way Guide for Ethical Research to invite contributions from the class.
