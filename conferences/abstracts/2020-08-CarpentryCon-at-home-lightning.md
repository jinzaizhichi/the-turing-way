_The Turing Way_ is a community-driven book project that involves and supports a diverse research community in ensuring that reproducible and ethical data research is "too easy not to do". 

It aims to bridge the gap between innovative data research techniques and best practices that make them accessible and comprehensible for everyone. 
_The Turing Way_ is designed to be inclusive and accessible to its members from diverse backgrounds and expertise. We welcome ideas, case studies, impact stories, educational resources, or any sort of participation that individuals can benefit from or use to advance their knowledge in data research. 
All contributions, questions, comments, and discussions via an online repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way. 

In this lightning talk, a community member will introduce this project and highlight the importance of creating a culture that promotes collaboration to ensure the long-term sustainability of our communities.
