## Title: Creating a Jupyter Book with The Turing Way

Audience level 
- Novice

Target Audience: 
Please provide details of the level of programming and other topic-specific experience this tutorial is aiming for. Who is this tutorial the most beneficial for?
- Anyone with prior knowledge of using GitHub for project repositories. Basic experience working with Markdown files and Jupyter notebook will be a plus. 

Summary: 
A short paragraph, a maximum of 400 characters. If your proposal is accepted, this will be in the public program.
Tutorial format 
- Jupyter Book is an open source project for building publication-ready books with computational files. The Turing Way is a community-led book project on learning computational skills, which is hosted online as a Jupyter Book. In this tutorial, you will learn about the collaborative nature of both the projects and create your own book using files and chapters from The Turing Way as examples.

Please describe what portion of the tutorial will be spent on the video presentation, hands-on exercises, and self-assessment or knowledge checks (if any). This does not have to be laid minute-by-minute but gives an overall idea of how the 3 hours will be distributed.

**Proposed Agenda:**
- 5 minutes: Introduction to the workshop 
- 10 minutes: Icebreakers for the participants to get to know each other (breakout)
- 30 minutes: Introduction to The Turing Way and Jupyter Book projects
- 15 minutes: Demo of The Turing Way GitHub repository and its Jupyter Book
- 80 minutes: Hands-on session on creating a Jupyter Book on GitHub that will include the following:
    - teaching how to deploy the Jupyter Book using continuous integration tests of GitHub actions
    - working with the collaborative workflow on GitHub repository to edit a chapter or propose edits on Jupyter Book
    - using Sphinx features in Jupyter Book (for cross-referencing, citation, etc.) 
- 20 minutes: Troubleshooting and demos in small groups (breakout)
- 20 minutes: Open Q&A, Wrap-up and shared reflection on the workshop

Outline: 
Your outline should list the topics and activities you will guide your students through during your 3-hour tutorial.
- The workshop will start by introducing the importance of reproducibility in research.
- The session leads will then present The Turing Way as a community-developed book project that teaches best practices in data science for research reproducibility, project design, communication, collaboration and ethics.
- The project's workflow of creating Jupyter Book will be introduced as an example of the reproducible way for hosting online books
- A demo of The Turing Way's GitHub repository will explain how a Jupyter book is created and how they are hosted online
- A longer hands-on session will be carried out to create Jupyter Book on GitHub, using The Turing Way chapters and files if your interest as examples
- We will further show how to deploy JupyterBook with continuous integration tests using github actions
- We will show the collaborative workflow to collaborate on GitHub and propose edits on Jupyter Book
- Breakout sessions will be used for demo and troubleshooting from the participants in small groups
- The session will end with open Q&A and sharing details on how participants can gain further support when working with Jupyter Books and The Turing Way

The following fields are for the review process, but are optional and will not be published publicly.
Experience and any other information you would like the reviewers to know.
Please summarize your teaching or public speaking experience, as well as your experience with the subject of the tutorial. Also, indicate if you have prior experience creating online or recorded content.
- I am comfortable with public speaking and have created many recorded contents. I am The Carpentries certified instructor and instructor trainer. I have conducted several technical training as a community manager in my current role and previous organizations. I co-lead the Open Life Science mentoring and training program that teaches Open Science skills to early career researchers and academics. The project, The Turing Way, is collaboratively developed online on a GitHub repository and the contents are hosted as a JupyterBook on Netlify. I will be conducting this training with the co-leads, Martina G. Vilas and Sarah Gibson. Both Sarah and Martina are core maintainers of the JupyterBook infrastructure of The Turing Way and have contributed directly to the Jupyter Book project. Sarah is also a core maintainer of JupyterHub and Binder.


Is this your first time presenting at JupyterCon?
