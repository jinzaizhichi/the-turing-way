# README and Project Communication

README files are the welcome mat for your project.
They are the first thing new visitors to your project will see and are part of a set of essential documents that make potential contributors feel welcome and invite them to get involved.
Your [README file](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) should cover:
* What you are doing, for whom, and why.
* What makes your project special and exciting.
* How to get started.
* Where to find key resources.

An [Open Canvas](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/develop-an-open-project-strategy-with-open-canvas/) can be a good tool to help you clarify what you want to achieve with your project and what you should cover in your README file.
