## What to learn next

If you have not already read the testing chapter it is suggested to do so to learn more about the different kinds of tests and their benefits in order to make the most of CI.

## Further reading

Travis offers many functionalities not described here for automating other processes related to the testing and deployment of projects. Look into these, the Travis [documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment) offers a good starting point for this.

A list of example Travis builds and tests for various languages/frameworks is available [here](https://github.com/softwaresaved/build_and_test_examples).

Travis's official tutorial is [here](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/). A tutorial focused on using Travis with R can be found [here](https://juliasilge.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-travis/), tutorials geared towards Python can be found [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/ci/) and [here](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python/).
